# Sanity Studio Deployment Guide

## Overview
The Sanity Studio is now integrated into your Next.js application and will be deployed alongside your website at `/studio`.

**Last Updated**: January 30, 2025 - Studio is fully operational!

## Access URLs

### Local Development
- **Studio URL**: `http://localhost:3000/studio`
- **Website URL**: `http://localhost:3000`

### Production (Vercel)
- **Studio URL**: `https://notes-websites.vercel.app/studio`
- **Website URL**: `https://notes-websites.vercel.app`

## What Was Set Up

### 1. Studio Route Structure
```
src/app/studio/
â”œâ”€â”€ [[...tool]]/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx          # Main studio page component
â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx            # Studio-specific layout
```

### 2. Configuration Files
- **`sanity.config.ts`** - Main Sanity configuration
- **`next.config.ts`** - Updated with transpilation settings for Sanity packages

### 3. Key Features
- âœ… **Integrated Studio** - Runs within your Next.js app
- âœ… **Production Ready** - Builds successfully for deployment
- âœ… **Proper Routing** - Handles all studio sub-routes
- âœ… **Clean Layout** - Isolated from main app layout
- âœ… **Environment Variables** - Uses your existing Sanity project settings

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel deployment:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=8udeaunz
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

## Studio Access

### Authentication
When you first access the studio in production, you'll need to:
1. Sign in with your Sanity account
2. Make sure your account has access to the project `8udeaunz`

### Content Management
The studio provides access to all your schemas:
- Subject Pages (for dynamic routing)
- Subject Grid
- Header/Footer content
- Hero sections
- FAQ content
- And more...

## Deployment Notes

### Automatic Deployment
- The studio will be automatically deployed when you push to your main branch
- No separate deployment process needed
- Uses the same environment variables as your main app

### Build Optimization
- Studio is built as a dynamic route for optimal performance
- Static content is pre-rendered where possible
- Images are optimized through Sanity CDN

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Studio not loading**: Check environment variables are set correctly
2. **Authentication issues**: Verify your Sanity account has project access
3. **Build failures**: Ensure all Sanity packages are up to date
4. **Browser caching**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or incognito mode

### Support
- Check Sanity documentation: https://www.sanity.io/docs
- Verify project settings in Sanity dashboard
- Ensure CORS settings allow your domain

## Security

### Production Considerations
- Studio is protected by Sanity authentication
- Only authorized users can access content management
- All changes are tracked and versioned
- Content is served through Sanity's secure CDN

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Push your changes to trigger deployment
2. **Test Studio Access** - Visit `/studio` on your production URL
3. **Invite Team Members** - Add collaborators in Sanity dashboard
4. **Configure CORS** - Add your production domain to Sanity CORS settings if needed

Your Sanity Studio is now ready for production! ðŸš€
